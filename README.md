# HateBrain Changelog

HateBrain is the NLP (natural language processing) engine at the heart of Hatebase, and is used to analyze text on-the-fly and establish a probability that the content is hate speech. HateBrain has generated hundreds of thousands of unique, timestamped, geotagged datapoints in the Hatebase database, and powers the /analyze endpoint in the Hatebase API.

Although HateBrain is not open source, neither is it a black box, and so this changelog has been created to help consumers of the Hatebase API understand something of the inner workings of HateBrain, as well as to keep track of enhancements as they become available.
