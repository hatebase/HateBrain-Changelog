# HateBrain v1.0

~~~
Deployed April 2013
~~~

This was the initial implementation of HateBrain, which was primarily a keyword-matching algorithm that:

* Acquired social media posts using the Hatebase vocabulary as search queries
* Geolocated a subset of those posts, using existing geocoordinates or location data retrieved from the poster's public profile
* Applied deletion rules such as indications of clinical usage
* Applied unambiguity rules to identify terms which can only be used in a hate speech context
* Applied capture rules using escalation terms, xenophobic keywords and the known classifications of previous author posts

Between 2013 and 2018, HateBrain 1.0 generated approximately 600k timestamped, geotagged sightings of hate speech around the world.
