## Features

### Large increase of pilotfish

We've dramatically increased the number of multilingual pilotfish in Hatebase and incorporated banned words from a variety of public sources.

### Alternate wordforms

Pilotfish now have multiple wordforms (e.g. verb tenses, misspellings, hyphenation, leetspeak), which allows for more nuanced analysis of hate speech.
