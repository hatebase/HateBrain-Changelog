~~~
Deployed January 2019

## Features

### Leetspeak

Users of hate speech often attempt to obfuscate keywords that might otherwise flag their posts for moderation or deletion, and one popular means of obfuscation is [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). This version of HateBrain has a build in leet encoder / decoder to tackle most obvious leet transformations. While there are endless additional forms of obfuscation available to content creators, these come at the cost of comprehensibility and are less likely to be used (since ultimately the purpose of posting hate speech is to be understood).

### Support for racist punctuation

HateBrain can now identify the (((echo))) construction used by white supremacists to denote a global Jewish conspiracy.

### Support for emojis

HateBrain now detects and weighs the presence of specific emojis that have been known to be used in the [context of sexual harassment, racism or xenophobia](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/9405/7571).
